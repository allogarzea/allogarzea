Salut, Je suis _Thiago Campos_

A software engineer and a design enthusiast, living in the beautiful landscapes of Mantiqueira, Brazil. 
My interests lead me to believe that being at the intersection of technology and the humanities gives my projects a purpose that transcends technology as a mere end in itself.
